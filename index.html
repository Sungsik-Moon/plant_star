<p style="margin-top:40px;"><br><br>Social finance is often used to describe the lending and investment into companies who consider themselves social enterprises, charities, co-operatives, and other impact-focused organisations.
<br><br>The term can include community investing, microfinance, social impact bonds, investing into sustainable businesses, and social enterprise lending.
