<h2>Impact Investment란 무엇인가?</h2>

<p>Impact investing refers to investments "made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside (or in lieu of) a financial return."[1]<br>

Institutional investors, notably North American and European development finance institutions, pension funds and endowments have played a leading role in the development of impact investing holistically, across all asset classes, with an initial focus on private equity, venture capital and green infrastructure.[2] Under Pope Francis, the Catholic Church has witnessed an increased interest in impact investing.[3]
<br>
"Impact investments can be made in emerging and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below-market to above-market rates, depending upon the circumstances." Impact investing tends to have roots in either social issues or environmental issues, and has been contrasted with microfinance.[4] Impact investors actively seek to place capital in businesses, nonprofits, and funds that can harness the positive power of enterprise. Impact investing occurs across asset classes; for example, private equity/venture capital, debt, and fixed income.
